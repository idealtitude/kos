# kos

**Keter O.S.** (kos (1)) is an operating system... Well actually it is in its conception stage. There's yet a lot of steps to do, from design to effective start of the development.
Based on my user experience, I've formed several concepts of what I expect from an O.S., from its core design to its desktop environment, and then there's many ideas I'd like to implement.
I want it to be made from scratch, from boot to the shell and the desktop, yet simple but powerfull.

Maybe this project may interest you or even may want you contribute?

### NOTES

(1) I've choose this name because “kos” has also a meaning in hebrew, and [it means “cup”](https://translate.google.fr/?sl=iw&tl=en&text=%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%A1&op=translate "Google Translation").
For my projects I often try to use a name of which the acronym can be a word in other languages.
**Keter** is also an hebrew word, and it means “crown”; it's the meaning of my first name: Stéphane (from the greek “Στέφανος” ([Strong 4736](https://saintebible.com/greek/4736.htm "Online Strong's Concordance")); see also the Book of **Acts, chap. 6**).
